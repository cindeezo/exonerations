MOTIVATION
    Exoneration is not only individual tragedies but also systemic failures that undermine trust in the justice system. Understanding the common patterns in wrongful convictions, whether related to race, official misconduct, or legal defense quality can shed light on where reforms are most urgent.
    This project is personally motivated by my work and ongoing involvement in the criminal justice field, as well as my interest in discussions around reform, fairness, and accountability. By exploring data-driven insights, this work aims to raise awareness and support efforts that can inform policymakers, researchers, and advocacy groups striving for a more equitable justice system.
