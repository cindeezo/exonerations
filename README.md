# MOTIVATION ‚öñÔ∏è 

Exoneration is not only individual tragedies but also systemic failures that undermine trust in the justice system. Understanding the common patterns in wrongful convictions, whether related to race, official misconduct, or legal defense quality can shed light on where reforms are most urgent.

This project is personally motivated by my work and ongoing involvement in the criminal justice field, as well as my interest in discussions around reform, fairness, and accountability. By exploring data-driven insights, this work aims to raise awareness and support efforts that can inform policymakers, researchers, and advocacy groups striving for a more equitable justice system.

# DATA QUESTIONS ‚ùì 

1. Which was the first state to have an exoneration? And when?
2. Max of years lost.
3. How many exoneratinos have been done based on gender? And based on Race (Top 3)?
4. What's the importance of the yuear 1989 whe it comes to exonerations? What's the difference between pre-1989 and post-1989?
5. Are certain crimes (e.g., murder, sexual assault, drug offenses) more prone to wrongful convictions/sentences? What are the top 5 types of crimes that have had wrongful convictions?
6. A visualization showing the percentage of types of senteces from the whole dataset.
7. What is the average years lost based on the Top 5 Crimes?
8. Show a visualization showing how race is a factor when it comes to Official Misconduct.
9. How does race and official misconduct intersect with wrongful conviction rates?
    
# TECHNOLOGY USED üíæ 

### Visualizations:

- Time-series trends of exonerations by crime type and year.
  
- Demographic breakdowns (race, gender).
  
- Frequency of wrongful conviction factors (false confession, misconduct, faulty evidence, etc.).
  
- Geographic distribution (heat maps of states with highest exonerations).
  
### Analysis & Presentation:

- Jupyter Notebook with statistical analysis.
  
- Interactive dashboard using Power BI to allow exploration by audience.
  
### Intended Audience:

- Criminal justice researchers, advocacy groups (for example: Innocence Project), policymakers, and academic peers.
  
# DATA SOURCES üìä 
National Registry of Exonerations: https://exonerationregistry.org/cases (University of Michigan Law School, Michigan State University, University of California Irvine)

# KNOWN ISSUES & CHALLENGES üß∞ 

‚Ä¢ Data Cleaning: Exoneration datasets might have missing values.

‚Ä¢ Data Access: Datasets may require rgistration and a license.

‚Ä¢ Interpretation: Legal categories may need careful definition to avoid misclassification. Will provide term dictionary.

‚Ä¢ Bias & Sensitivity: The topic involves sensitive racial information, requiring careful handling to avoid misrepresentation.

# CONCLUSION ‚ú® 

The data analysis highlights the persistent racial disparities within the criminal justice system, revealing that Black individuals are disproportionately affected by wrongful convictions and official misconduct compared to other racial groups. My findings also show that Illinois leads the nation in wrongful convictions and was the first state in history to record exonerations. Most of these exonerations involve murder cases, which rank among the top five crimes in my analysis. Race plays a significant role, where Black individuals are approximately 7.5 times more likely to be wrongfully convicted of murder than white individuals and about 80% more likely to be innocent, according to a recent report by the National Registry of Exonerations. Therefore, it is crucial to increase education and awareness about these issues to inspire local action toward criminal justice reform, advocate for the release of those still wrongfully convicted, and work to prevent future injustices.
